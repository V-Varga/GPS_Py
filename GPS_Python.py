Description:
	This program takes 3 input files (a file containing genetic-geographical association
		data for test individuals, a dataset giving the geographical locations of a variety
		of sample populations, and a file containing genetic-geographical association data
		for sample populations), and outputs a file predicting the geographical origins of
		the test individuals.
	The results file is in .txt format, and can be used as input for the CSV_Conversion.py file,
		in order to produce a file formatted in such a way as to be mapped in QGIS.

Citation Note:
This program is a derivative work.
The GPS_Python.py script is a translation into Python from R of the GPS.r script
	found at https://github.com/homologus/GPS/blob/master/GPS.r written by Homolog.us
	(@homologus on GitHub: https://github.com/homologus).
The larger GPS program, which includes more than the GPS.r script, can be found at
	https://github.com/homologus/GPS.

List of Functions:
	GPS

List of Standard & Non-Standard Modules:
	sys
	numpy
	pandas
	sklearn

Procedure:
	1. Necessary modules are loaded, including the sklearn objects that will be used to
		calculate the Euclidian Distance Matrix and Linear Regression. The inputs and
		output are defined.
	2. The GPS function is defined. Within the function, the following processes occur:
		a. Input files are opened with Pandas.
		b. The Euclidian Distance Matrices and Linear Regression are calculated with sklearn.
		c. The contents of the 3 input files are parsed in order to create the results file.
	3. The program is executed.

Input & Output Files:
	There are 3 input files necessary for this program to run, all in .csv format. Details
		about the formatting and contents of these files are described below:
	- data_file: This is the file containing genetic-geographical association data for test
		individuals. It contains sample ids, geographical-genetic association data, and a
		population group assignment.
		Its column formatting is as follows:
		SAMPLE_ID, NORTHEASTASIAN, MEDITERRANIAN, SOUTHAFRICA, SOUTHWESTASIAN, NATIVEAMERICAN,
		OCEANIAN, SOUTHEASTASIA, NORTHERNEUROPEAN, SUBSAHARANAFRICA, GROUP_ID
	- geo_file: This file contains the geographical locations of various sample populations.
		Its column formatting is as follows:
		POPULATION, Lat, Long
	- gen_file: This file contains genetic-geographical association data for a variety of sampled
		populations. This file does not contain headers, but its contents align with the genetic-
		geographical associations columns present in the data_file, preceded by a column containing
		the sample group ids.
	The output file contains the results of the file parsing accomplished in this program. It is
		a .txt file, and its contents are found under the following column names:
		Population, Sample_no, Sample_id, Prediction, Lat, Lon
	To download sample files and test the program, please visit the website of the original program,
		linked above in the Citation Note section.

Known Bugs & Limitations:
	- The input files have to look exactly as described above, and be in the order listed in
		the usage instructions below. Any deviation will cause either program failure or unusable
		results.
	- No error-checking has been integrated into this program: it is up to the user to unsure the
		correct files and file formats are provided to the program, and the determine which file(s)
		is/are causing an issue if the program does not run.
	- The quality of the geographical predictions is limited by the diversity of the population and
		group data provided. The greater the diversity of the input data, the more accurate the
		predictions will be.
	- The name assigned to the output file is pre-determined, and can only be changed from within
		the script.
	- The user may encounter the following error message:
		".\GPS_Python.py:216: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide
  			W = (minE[0]/minE)**4"
		This error message can be safely ignored - the program will complete running not much later.

This script was written with Python 3.8.6 in Spyder 4.

'''
Note:
	There is some minor discrepancy of the latitude and longitude coordinates calculated in this
		Python program, vs. the original program written in R. This has been determined to be due
		to the usage of the sklearn module in order to calculate the Euclidian Distance Matices.
	The `dist()` command accomplishes this task in R, but the sklearn module's DistanceMetric
		command actually calculates the values in the distance matrices to a higher number of
		decimal places. The succeeding mathematical operations (which include transformation via
		the use of exponents), cause these originally quite small deviations to become noticable
		in the final output of the program.
